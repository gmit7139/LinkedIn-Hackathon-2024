# LinkedIn-Hackathon-2024
## This is the repository for the LinkedIn Hackathon 2024 project my teammates Amy Tran, Alisa Phil, and Joseann Boneo, and I developed.
### This project enhances the LinkedIn Learning platform by adding gamification elements such as leaderboards and accountability partners, and by incorporating interactive elements within video lectures. The project includes web-based mockups and data analysis to support these new features.
### The HTML file creates a simple mockup for the LinkedIn Learning platform. It includes an image and a video that users can click through to simulate the learning experience. The JavaScript file toggles between images to simulate the user's learning journey on the platform. The Python script performs data analysis using Pandas to support the new features. It calculates and visualizes course completion rates and the distribution of course difficulty levels.
